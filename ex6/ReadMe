ex6  == Blackjack App

This simulates a game of blackjack.  You will notice that it is not complete.
That is your job.  right now we have defined all the classes we need.  We have
created a driver app.  Find the requirements below.  Determine what is already done,
what needs to be modified, what needs to be created, what needs to be changed from
existing.

Requirements:

1. A deck of cards consists of Ace through King for each of 4 suits: Spades; Clubs;
Hearts; and Diamonds.

2. Just like in real life, there should be only one copy of a card in each deck.

3. The dealer first deals two cards to the player, and then two cards to itself.
The player is shown both of their cards, but the dealer only shows the player the first
one of theirs.  The dealer however is aware of both.

4. The player has the option to hold, or draw another card from the dealer.  This
continues until the player stops or he hits 21.

5. Once the player is done, the dealer keeps picking cards until he has a minimum of
17.  If he goes over 21, he loses.

6. After everything is done, the closest to 21 wins.

7. A tie results in a 'push' where neither player wins.

8. An Ace is worth either 1 or 11 points, at the discrection of the player.  If the dealer gets an ace,
it is either 1 or 11 depending on what is most relevent at the time.  The dealer will keep drawing cards
until he is over 16 or busts.  The ace will be 1 if it results in a bust, or 11 if not.

9.  After each game, the app should prompt the user if they should play again.  A q or Q should result
in the end of the game.

10. Each game should print the results and allow the user to continue or stop.
