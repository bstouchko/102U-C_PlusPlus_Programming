ex2  ==  Passing in variables to your program.

You can pass in variables as you launch your program too.  While you
can tell vscode to do this in the settings, we will open a command line
to run our program to try this.

To build the code, press <ctrl> <shift> and <b> all at the same time.
If you get compiler errors, read the error and try to correct it.
If you can't correct it, take a look at google and see what that says
about your error.

To run your code, go into file explorer where your exe was built.  (its under
the /bin folder).  Click once in the url bar for the folder after the 'example' text.
The entire path will be highlighted.  Don't click any more.  While the text
is highlighted type cmd and press enter.  You should now have a command window
in the same directory as your executable.  In the command window type:

ex2 <your name>

(without the brackets), see what happens.

// Things to try...

1. type in something else other than your name.

2. type in a number.
