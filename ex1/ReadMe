ex1  ==  Hello World.

This is the first program students to programming usually do.
Hello World.  This is simply a way to orient yourself with the IDE
and vscode.

To build the code, press <ctrl> <shift> and <b> all at the same time.
If you get compiler errors, read the error and try to correct it.
If you can't correct it, take a look at google and see what that says
about your error.

// Things to try...

1. Play around with the text.  Change it around.

2. Add another line of text.

3. See if you can print both on a single line (using two seperate cout).
Hint: Google 'std::endl'.  What does it mean?

4. Try to print the text combined with a variable.

5. Try printing a floating point number.
