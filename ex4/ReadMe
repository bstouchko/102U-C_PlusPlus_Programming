ex4  ==  Input and Output.

A simple project that shows how we can get input and output.

Getting data from the user (or any other part of the system, i.e. robot)
is a very important part of computing.  Most of this information is processed
and sent back to the user or another part of the system.  There are many
many ways to get and send data on a system.  Most of the time this depends on
the system and what means it has in order to transfer data.  The most common
that we see with computers is keyboard input and screen output.  However, we can
also get and send data from the usb port on a computer.  On embedded systems such
as the robot, we have a number of other means to get and send that are important.
Some of these include: usb; ethernet; uart; spi; i2c; and can bus.  The method
is determined by the distance the data needs to go as well as speed and size.  For
instance, can bus is widely used on our robot to transfer data to and from the
motor controllers, solenoids for pneumatics, and other controls.  We use usb or ethernet
for direct connection to our computer so we can upload new code.  We can also use these
for communications to other sensors and light strips.

Things to try:
1. Build the exe and run it from the command line the same was as in ex2.  From the command
prompt just type ex4

2. Change the message above and put the program in a loop until the user presses q to quit.

3. Same as above, but allow the user to select either q or Q.

4. Same as above, but let the user first select the maximum number.  Be careful, this
sounds easier than it is.  You need to make sure all areas of the program that use the maximum
number must accomodate your maximum value that is entered by the user.  This is called 'dynamic'
response, or constraints of the program are figured out as the user uses the program and not when
we compile it.
